This project contains my exercises on <a href="https://oj.leetcode.com">oj.leetcode.com</a>. My programming language set includes, but is not limited to C++/Java/Python.

Most solutions are written in Java (a few solutions are solely written in C++). Some solutions are written in C++ in the beginning and optimized in Java afterwards, so Java solutions are likely to have better time/space complexity. Moreover, a few of these solutions have Python version.

Leetcode is a great website for helping people sharpening their programming skills and learning algorithms / data structures in a comfortable way. Until now, I have finished all 153 leetcode problems for at least one time. The other solutions will be occasionally updated. Advices and discussions on my solutions are appreciated.
